# Polyshape
Polyshape is a small project used to learn and apply html canvas concept.
The application is interactive and very pleasent to look at. 
The idea of the app is based in colored dots moving through the screen and 
lines beeing created between 2 dots when they are close enough, which creates
a nice visual effect when there are lots of dots on.

## How to run
Sadly, it's not possible to run the app just by cloning this rep and executing the
index.html file. Due to JavaScript security policy the script can't be called from
a physical address, you must use a local server (in my case I used the live server extension from VS Code).

## App preview
This is what the app must look like
